## Finished  
 - Simulation Function Built  
 - Vary random and fixed parameters  
 - Vary Spatial extent parameter to test mixture model  
 
## To Do  
 - Build up spatial temporal model  
 - Do is use all data at once or break them up by cluster groups?  
 - Modeling scenarios should include  
   - Vary spatial extent  
   - Simulate outcomes using refernces from survey data ie clusters from MICS and DHS
   - Use the births from each cluster,year and simulate through age groups.
   - Use only point, only polygon, and both types of data.
